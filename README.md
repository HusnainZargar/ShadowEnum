# SubEnum

**SubEnum** is a fast asynchronous subdomain enumeration tool built in Python. It uses **aiodns** with **Cloudflare resolvers** to brute force subdomains, filtering duplicates based on unique IP sets.

## Features

- ⚡ Asynchronous DNS resolution for high performance  
- 🌍 Uses Cloudflare DNS (`1.1.1.1` & `1.0.0.1`)  
- 🔎 Filters duplicate subdomains that resolve to the same IPs  
- 🎨 Color-coded output for better visibility  
- 🛠️ Simple CLI usage
